## Work Experience

I have about a year of web development experience. Almost all this time I have been working in a small company that develop websites for state institutions. I know what semantic, responsive and cross-browser development is and I can work with layouts in Figma and Photoshop. I have experience writing basic JavaScript logic (such as creating sliders, modals, burger-menus), working in a React project, and building a project component library.


## Education

In 2020, I graduated as a master's degree from Donetsk National Technical University (Faculty of Computer Science and Technology, Software Engineering).


## English level

According to the site [Ef Set](https://www.efset.org/ru/), my level of English is in the range from B1 to B2. I can use the documentation in English without any problems and know many terms related to IT and Web-development. I am still continuing to improve my English.
